# üß† System Design ‚Äì Customer Support Ticket Analyzer

This multi-agent system consists of two core components:

---

## 1. Ticket Classifier Agent

- **Output:** `priority_label` and `explanation`
- **How it works:** 
  - Uses a local Phi-3 model via Ollama
  - Prompt instructs it to classify based on tone, urgency, and customer tier

---

## 2. Ticket Router Agent

- **Input:** `priority_label`, `monthly_revenue`, and `customer_tier`
- **Output:** Routing department and justification
- **Logic:**
  - VIP or Pro + High Priority ‚Üí `priority-support`
  - All else ‚Üí `low-priority`
