## 🧭 PROJECT ROADMAP (Executed)

### PHASE 1: Setup
- ✅ Installed Python, pip, VS Code, Git
- ✅ Set up and activated Python virtual environment
- ✅ Installed Ollama and downloaded phi3 model
- ✅ Created clean folder structure

### PHASE 2: Agent System
- ✅ Built ticket classifier agent using local model
- ✅ Built router agent with business logic
- ✅ Integrated both into `main.py`

### PHASE 3: Evaluation
- ✅ Ran 5 realistic + 2 edge-case tickets
- ✅ Printed classifier + router output
- ✅ Logged correctness of results

### PHASE 4: Documentation
- ✅ Created README.md
- ✅ Created EVALUATION.md
- 🔜 Save chat history
- 🔜 Push code to GitHub
- 🔜 Compose submission email

## 🤖 PROMPT ENGINEERING

### Classifier Prompt Template
- Role: You are a support ticket classifier
- Respond with: `Label: <priority>` and `Reason: <why>`

### Fallbacks Built In
- If label line missing, use keywords like “urgent”, “frustration”, “low”, etc.
- Strip markdown characters like `**Label:` using regex

---

## 🧪 EVALUATION RESULTS SUMMARY

- All test cases correctly classified
- Routing decisions aligned with urgency + tier + value
- System output:
  ```
  🏷️ Priority Label: High
  📝 Explanation: ... 
  📦 Routed To: priority-support
  📋 Routing Reason: ...
  ```

---

## 💡 CHALLENGES SOLVED

- ❌ OpenAI quota error → switched to local Phi3 model
- ❌ pydantic-ai import issue → avoided CLI dependency
- ❌ LLM not always giving label → added fallback logic
- ✅ Everything now works via local interactive terminal
